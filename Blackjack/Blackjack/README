**Blackjack**
Game of Blackjack for 1-4 players according to classic rules

Runs through main method of Program.cs file
While in directory directly containg Program.cs file, enter dotnet run in terminal to run

Is not implemented:
- Removing betted amount from players bank
- Showing dealer's hidden card on dealer's turn

Could be nice to have in game:
- Appropriate spacing between messages from game
- More classes containg functionalities from Game.cs
- Less calls to Hand objects through Player objects
